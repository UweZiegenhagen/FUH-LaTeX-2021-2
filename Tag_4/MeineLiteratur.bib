  abstract    = {This note presents selected measurements of W and Z boson production, carried out with the CMS experiment at the LHC, based on samples of events collected during 2015-2018 physics runs. W boson events were selected containing an isolated, energetic electron or muon, while Z boson events were selected containing a pair of isolated, energetic electrons or muons. Presented results include searches for rare decays of W bosons to pions.},
